# TECHNOLOGY TYPES

This is my first web code project with the Code Institute.
It's a simple web construct.

The technologies employed are:
## HTML

I used HTML to provide structure and the link anchor tags to each page, supporting the layout

## CSS

I used CSS to style the page, and float the technology elements on the page in a neat order

Essentially we provide a clickable list of various technologies used in web developemnt against groupings abitarially call streams
clicking on each presented element will take you a wiki-page provining more detail on that technonogy.
