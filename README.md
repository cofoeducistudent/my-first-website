# TECHNOLOGY TYPES

This is my first web code project with the Code Institute.
It's a simple web construct.

The technologies employed are:
## HTML
## CSS

Essentially we provide a clickable list of various technologies used in web developemnt against groupings abitarially call streams
clicking on each presented element will take you a wiki-page provining more detail on that technonogy.
